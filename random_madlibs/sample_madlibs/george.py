the first {occ1}. I am writing from (the) {place1}, where I have been secretly \
living for the past {num1} years. I am concerned by the {adj1} state of affairs in \
America these days. It seems that your politicians are more concerned with {verbing1} \
one another than with listening to the {p_noun2} of the people. When we declared our \
independence from (the) {place2}, we set forth on a/an {adj2} path guided by the \
voices of the everyday {p_noun3}. If we're going to keep {verbing2}, then we need \
to respect all {p_noun4}. Don't get me wrong; we had {adj3} problems in my day too \
Bejamin Franklin once called me a/an {noun} and kicked me in the {body_part1}. \
But a the end of the day, we were able to {verb} in harmony. Let us find that {adj4} \
spirit once again, or else I'm taking my {body_part2} off the quarter!"
